            <h1>Choose Your Destination</h1>
            <p>Choosing a place to go when you have the opportunity to travel can sometimes be overwhelming. However,
                you can easily narrow your choices down with a thoughtful approach. Considering basic concerns, like
                what you and everyone else coming along enjoys doing, is an important first step. From there, factoring
                in how much money and time you have will further help you choose between destinations. Finally,
                comparing your final choices based on additional concerns, like the time of year and ease of travelling,
                will help you decide between them.</p>
